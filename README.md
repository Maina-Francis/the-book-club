## The idea behind the project
The Book Club is a personalized online book library where users can access as well as keep a track of the books they are currently reading. 
Readers can scroll through a variety of books in the library, and add them to their current read if the book intrests them. Users can also delete books they no longer need from the library or their current read list. In the event a reader can't find a book they are looking for in the library, they can add the book by filling the wishlist form and the book will be added to their library.
